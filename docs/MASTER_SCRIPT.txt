━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 PART ONE: THE WORLD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 §1  THE PREMISE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  In another life, he married the singer. Bought the mansion.
  Did the tabloid dance. Got comfortable.

  In THIS life, he stayed hungry.

  The year is ambiguous — somewhere in a version of Hollywood that
  feels like now but isn't quite. A screenwriter from Dorchester
  who won an Oscar at 25 for a script he wrote on napkins at
  Dunkin' Donuts has spent the last decade watching other people
  make his words worse. He's directed a few films. Some good.
  One that got him taken seriously. But directing isn't enough.
  He doesn't want to make ONE good movie. He wants to make the
  PLACE where good movies come from.

  He's bought a bankrupt studio lot in the hills above Burbank.
  It's a dump. One soundstage that leaks. A garage where someone
  was definitely living. A view of the valley that, on a clear day,
  makes you understand why people came here in the first place.

  The trades think he's lost his mind. The streamers think he's
  irrelevant. His mother thinks he should come home to Boston.
  His best friend thinks he's a genius.

  He's going to build Pacific Dreams Studios.
  Or he's going to go broke trying.

  TONE:
  - Funny but not a comedy. Warm but not soft.
  - The humor comes from characters who are sharp, self-aware,
    and trapped in an absurd industry they genuinely love.
  - Think: the dialogue energy of Entourage meets the heart
    of Ted Lasso meets the structural ambition of Fable.
  - The player should LIKE these people. Even the antagonists.
  - Boston authenticity matters. He says "wicked." He drops his
    R's when he's stressed. His loyalty is irrational and total.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 §2  THE PROTAGONIST — "THE KID FROM DORCHESTER"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  NAME: Not named. Referred to by others as "Boss," "Chief,"
        "Kid" (by the Suit), "Sweetheart" (by the Connector).
        The player IS the protagonist. Second person always.

  BACKSTORY (revealed through NPC dialogue across films):

  - Grew up in Dorchester, MA. Triple-decker apartment.
  - Mom still lives there. Calls every Sunday.
  - Won Best Original Screenplay at 25 with his best friend.
    (The friend stayed in Boston. More on him later.)
  - Directed three films. The third one — a crime drama set in
    Southie — got him taken seriously as more than a writer.
  - Spent his 30s doing uncredited rewrites for studios.
    Made money. Lost his soul. Watched directors butcher his pages.
  - At some point, something broke. He decided: if they won't
    make movies right, I'll build a place that does.
  - Used every dollar from the rewrite years to buy the lot.
  - Has exactly enough money to make one terrible movie.
  - If that movie flops, he's done. Back to Boston.

  THE PLAYER'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROTAGONIST:
  - The player makes the protagonist's decisions.
  - But the protagonist has opinions. NPCs reference what
    "you" did, but they also reference who "you" are.
  - The protagonist's Boston identity bleeds through:
    loyalty is everything, grudges are forever, family is
    complicated, and the underdog chip never comes off.

  WHAT THE PLAYER NEVER SEES:
  - The protagonist's face. No portrait. No mirror scene.
  - The protagonist's name. It's always "you."
  - This is deliberate. The player fills in the blank.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 §3  THE BEST FRIEND — DANNY SULLIVAN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Danny is the co-writer of the Oscar-winning script.
  He took his half of the money, went back to Boston, bought a
  bar in Southie, and never wrote another word. He's the happiest
  person in this story. He's also the protagonist's conscience.

  Danny doesn't appear as a gameplay NPC. He appears on the PVM
  monitor as TEXT MESSAGES and VOICEMAILS between films. He's the
  Greek chorus. The audience surrogate. The guy who says what
  the player is thinking.

  Danny's function: EMOTIONAL ANCHOR. He reminds the player (and
  the protagonist) where they came from, what matters, and that
  Hollywood is fundamentally insane.

 §4  THE TEAM — Your Four Horsemen
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  These four characters are with you from Film 1 to the end.
  They each own one beat of pre-production. They have opinions,
  memories, and they talk to each other (through dialogue
  referencing what the others said).


  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  4A. CARMEN REYES — "The Numbers Girl"
  Head of Development
  Icon: 👩‍💼
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  BACKSTORY:
  Former data analyst at Netflix. Quit because "they stopped caring
  about stories and started caring about completion rates." Followed
  you to Pacific Dreams because she believed in the mission. She's
  the first person you hired. She's also the most likely to tell
  you that you're wrong.

  She's the smartest person in any room she's in and she knows it,
  but she's not arrogant about it — she's just impatient with
  people who don't keep up. Half-Dominican, half-Irish (Boston
  connection — she grew up in JP). You've known her since she
  was doing market research for your third film.

  VOICE:
  - Precise. No wasted words.
  - Uses data like a weapon but cares about story underneath.
  - Dry humor. Never laughs at her own jokes.
  - Calls you "Boss" — started ironically, stuck.
  - When she's worried, she gets MORE precise, not less.
  - When she's excited, she lets one (1) exclamation point slip.

  SPEAKING STYLE:
  "The data suggests X" = she's certain
  "The data is... interesting" = she's worried
  "Do what you want, Boss" = she thinks you're making a mistake
  "Not bad" = highest possible praise

  APPEARS IN: Beat 1 (Market), Beat 5 (Greenlight)

  COMPLETE DIALOGUE BANK:

  ── BEAT 1: MARKET RESEARCH ──

  Greetings (Film 1, scripted first game):
    "Morning, Boss. First day of the rest of your life.
     Or the last day of your career. Let's find out."

    "I pulled the weekend numbers. The trades. Social sentiment.
     Here's what America is watching right now."

  Greetings (Film 2+, generic):
    "New data's in. Market shifted since last time."
    "Morning. Got coffee and audience analytics. The important stuff."
    "The landscape looks different this quarter. Take a look."

  Greetings (Film 2+, MEMORY-AWARE — last film was a hit):
    "Morning. Phones have been ringing since the premiere.
     Everyone wants to know what we're doing next. So — what are we doing next?"

  Greetings (Film 2+, MEMORY-AWARE — last film was a flop):
    "I'm not going to sugarcoat it. The numbers were bad.
     But the market moves fast. New quarter, new shot. Here's what I'm seeing."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — player picked cold genre last time and it worked):
    "You went against the data last time and it paid off.
     I'm still not sure if that was genius or luck. Let's test the theory."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — player picked cold genre last time and it flopped):
    "Last time you went against the grain and... well.
     Maybe listen to the numbers this time? Just a thought."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — 3+ films in same genre):
    "Boss, I need to say something. We've made [X] [genre] films in a row.
     The audience is starting to think that's all we do.
     [Genre] fatigue is real. The data shows a dropoff."

  Genre reactions (HOT):
    "[Genre]. Smart. The audience is hungry for this."
    "Strong pick. Every data point says this is the move."
    "Hot market for [genre]. You're swimming with the current."

  Genre reactions (WARM):
    "[Genre]. Solid. Not flashy, but there's an audience."
    "Steady choice. The market's neutral — it'll come down to execution."
    "Safe pick. Sometimes safe wins."

  Genre reactions (COLD):
    "[Genre]. That's... bold. The market is ice cold on this."
    "You sure? The last three [genre] films all underperformed."
    "Going against the data. I respect it. I also want it on the record that I advised against it."

  Genre reactions (COLD + MEMORY — player picked cold before and it worked):
    "Going cold again. Last time it worked, so I'll keep my mouth shut.
     This time."

  ── BEAT 5: GREENLIGHT ──

  Positive (quality estimate ≥ 4 stars):
    "I've crunched everything. Director, cast, market position.
     The numbers say we've got something here. I believe in this one."

    "This package is strong. Not perfect — nothing is —
     but the fundamentals are right."

  Neutral (quality estimate 3 stars):
    "It could go either way. We've got some strengths and some gaps.
     But you've been here before. Trust your instincts."

  Concerned (quality estimate ≤ 2 stars):
    "Boss, I'm going to be honest. The numbers are thin.
     This doesn't mean it can't work. It means it HAS to be
     better than the sum of its parts. That's on you."

  MEMORY-AWARE greenlight lines:
    (player has never flopped):
    "Your streak is intact. Don't think about it. Just make the movie."

    (player flopped last time):
    "We can't afford another miss. I don't say that to scare you.
     I say it because I think THIS one is different."

    (player has blockbuster streak):
    "At this point, the town trusts you.
     Don't let that make you careless."

  4B. RICKY NAVARRO — "The Scribe"
  Head Writer
  Icon: ✍️
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  BACKSTORY:
  Ricky is the only person at Pacific Dreams more talented than
  you, and he knows it. Former playwright. Won a MacArthur
  "Genius" Grant at 30 and spent the money on a houseboat.
  He writes the pitches for your films — the loglines, the
  concepts, the first 20 pages that make you feel something.

  You hired him because he was the only writer who sent you a
  pitch on a napkin. You recognized the move because you did
  the same thing once.

  He's dramatic. He's theatrical. He talks about stories like
  they're living things. He's also deeply insecure and hides it
  behind grandiosity. If a film flops, he takes it personally
  and doesn't sleep for a week.

  VOICE:
  - Theatrical. Speaks in moments and images.
  - Loves the sound of his own voice but it's a defense mechanism.
  - When he's excited, he stands up (referenced in stage directions).
  - When he's hurt, he gets quiet. Dangerously quiet.
  - Calls the protagonist "my friend" when happy, "boss" when not.
  - Uses em-dashes in speech like a playwright.

  SPEAKING STYLE:
  "I see it" = he's pitching
  "It's perfect" = he's excited
  "It's... fine" = he hates it
  "I need a drink" = something went wrong

  APPEARS IN: Beat 2 (Concept / Pitch)

  COMPLETE DIALOGUE BANK:

  ── BEAT 2: THE CONCEPT ──

  Greetings (Film 1, scripted):
    "So. You bought a studio and you need a movie.
     Lucky for you, I haven't slept in three days.
     I've got two pitches. Both are — and I mean this — perfect."

  Greetings (Film 2+, generic):
    "I've been writing. I've been LIVING these stories.
     Two pitches. Different vibes. Both extraordinary. Obviously."

    "Okay, okay, okay — sit down. You're going to love this."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — last film was a hit):
    "We're hot. The town is watching. This next one —
     this is where we prove it wasn't a fluke.
     I've got two ideas that could be THE one."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — last film was a flop):
    "I'm not going to talk about the last one. It's dead to me.
     What matters is THIS. I've been up for 72 hours. I see the movie.
     Let me show you."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — player chose custom title last time):
    "You wrote your own title last time. I respect that.
     I mean, I could have done better. But I respect it.
     This time — just HEAR my pitches first. Please."

  Pitch reactions (player picks a pitch):
    "YES. That's the one. I can SEE it, my friend.
     I can see the poster. I can hear the score. Let's go."

    "You feel that? That little electric thing in your chest?
     That's the movie telling you it wants to exist."

    "Good eye. The other one was good too — obviously, I wrote it —
     but THIS one has something. A pulse."

  Pitch reactions (player picks custom title):
    "You want to write your own? Fine. FINE. That's fine.
     I'll just... be over here. With my MacArthur Grant.
     Unused. Gathering dust."

    "Alright. Your title. Your vision.
     I'll make it work. I always do."

  Rating reactions:
    G: "G-rated? You want to make a... family film?
        That's either brilliant or terrifying. No middle ground."

    PG: "PG. Classic. Spielberg energy. I can work with that."

    PG-13: "PG-13. That's where the money is. Smart."

    R: "R-rated. Good. We can say what we actually mean.
        No filter. No safety net. This is where art lives."

    NC-17: "NC-17? Are you trying to get us shut down?
            I love it. Absolutely no one will see this film.
            But the people who DO see it? Changed forever."

  MEMORY-AWARE rating reactions:
    (player always picks R):
    "R again. You've never made a film under R.
     You know what that makes you? Consistent. Or stubborn.
     Either way — your brand."

    (player switches from R to PG):
    "Wait — PG? YOU? The person who said 'art should be uncomfortable'?
     Are you... growing? Evolving?
     Don't tell me Hollywood softened you."


  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  4C. ARTHUR COVINGTON III — "The Suit"
  Chief Financial Officer
  Icon: 💼
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  BACKSTORY:
  Arthur is old Hollywood money pretending to be new Hollywood
  pragmatism. His grandfather ran a studio in the 50s. His father
  lost it. He became a CFO because he wanted to be close to the
  industry without the risk of creating anything.

  He doesn't dislike you. He's fascinated by you — the way an
  entomologist is fascinated by a bug. A kid from Boston with
  no connections and no safety net trying to build a studio?
  Either it's the most inspiring thing he's ever seen or the
  most reckless. He hasn't decided yet.

  He has a leather-bound notebook from his grandfather with the
  words "PICTURES ARE COMMERCE" embossed on the cover. He keeps
  it on his desk. He's never opened it in front of anyone.

  VOICE:
  - Formal but not stiff. Old money cadence.
  - Uses "one" instead of "you" when being passive-aggressive.
  - Dry. Bone dry. Desert dry.
  - When he respects you, he drops the formality slightly.
  - When he's angry, he gets MORE formal, not less.
  - Calls you "Kid" — not affectionately. Observationally.

  SPEAKING STYLE:
  "The numbers work" = approved
  "One might reconsider" = absolutely not
  "Interesting" = he thinks you're insane
  "Don't make me regret this" = he's scared for you

  APPEARS IN: Beat 3 (Budget Negotiation), Beat 5 (Greenlight)

  COMPLETE DIALOGUE BANK:

  ── BEAT 3: THE MONEY ──

  Greetings (Film 1, scripted):
    "So. You've picked a genre and a concept. Now comes
     the part that actually matters. The money.
     You're new at this, Kid, so I'll keep it simple.
     You've got one option: small. Very small."

  Greetings (Film 2+, generic):
    "Let's talk numbers. What kind of budget are we looking at?"
    "I've seen the concept. Now show me the math."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — last film profitable):
    "The last one made money. I'm in a good mood.
     Don't ruin it. What do you need?"

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — last film lost money):
    "After [PREVIOUS FILM], I've got board members calling.
     Actual board members. On the phone. With me.
     So whatever you're about to ask for — be ready to defend it."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — player bluffed and got caught):
    "Before we start — I check the numbers now. Personally.
     After last time, I don't take anyone's word for anything.
     Especially yours."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — player has 2+ blockbusters):
    "At this point, Kid, you've earned more trust than most
     people get in this town. That's not a blank check.
     But it's close. What do you need?"

  Budget tier reactions:

    INDIE ($15M) approved:
      "Fifteen million. No objections.
       Low risk, low reward. Your call."

      "Lean budget. I like lean. Lean means disciplined."

    INDIE (MEMORY-AWARE — player always picks indie, Film 3+):
      "Indie again. You know, Kid, at some point you have to
       swing for the fences. Shareholders don't invest in singles.
       They invest in home runs."

    STUDIO ($60M) — negotiation prompt:
      "Sixty million. That's real money.
       Convince me this isn't a vanity project."

    STUDIO (MEMORY-AWARE — player got downgraded from Blockbuster last time):
      "Studio budget. Smart. Not reaching too far this time.
       I appreciate the... learning curve."

    BLOCKBUSTER ($120M) — negotiation prompt:
      "A hundred and twenty million dollars.
       That's more than your mother's house is worth.
       More than my mother's house is worth, and she lives in Bel Air.
       You better have answers."

    BLOCKBUSTER (MEMORY-AWARE — high rep):
      "Kid, if you'd asked me for this number two years ago,

  Negotiation answer responses:

    Bluff successful:
      "I checked. You're right. Fine. Approved.
       But I'm watching the dailies."

    Bluff caught:
      "I checked that too. You're wrong.
       Don't try to play me, Kid. I've been doing this
       since before you learned to spell 'screenplay.'
       Budget: downgraded."

    Market data answer (correct):
      "The data backs you up. The window is open.
       If we don't move now, someone else will. Approved."

    Market data answer (incorrect):
      "The data says the opposite. Did you even look at Carmen's report?
       I have. She's right. She's always right."

    Reputation answer (earned):
      "Your track record speaks for itself. I don't love saying that,
       but numbers don't lie. Approved."

    Reputation answer (unearned):
      "What track record? You've made [X] films. [Y] of them lost money.
       That's not a track record. That's a warning sign."

  ── BEAT 5: GREENLIGHT ──

    Positive:
      "The numbers work. Don't make me regret this."
      "I'll sign off. But I want weekly reports. On my desk. Tuesday mornings."

    Cautious:
      "I'm not confident. But I'm not saying no.
       That's the most dangerous kind of yes."

    MEMORY-AWARE:
      (player has never lost money):
      "You haven't lost us a dollar yet.
       I'm starting to think you might actually know what you're doing.
       Don't tell anyone I said that."

      (player lost money last time):
      "I'm approving this against my better judgment.
       If this one doesn't work, we need to have a different conversation."

  4D. MAX FONTAINE — "The Connector"
  Talent Agent / Head of Casting
  Icon: 🕶️
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  BACKSTORY:
  Max is a talent agent who followed you to Pacific Dreams because
  he saw the one thing no one else saw: an opportunity to build
  something from scratch. In the agency world, he was mid-level.
  At Pacific Dreams, he's the head of casting and the only person
  in town who picks up on the first ring.

  He talks like every conversation is the most important one
  he's ever had. He calls everyone "baby" or "sweetheart" —
  not because he's sleazy, but because he genuinely can't
  remember if your name is Steve or Scott and this is easier.

  He loves Hollywood the way a golden retriever loves a tennis
  ball — with absolute, uncritical, undying devotion. He's the
  most optimistic person in the building. He's also the most
  likely to overpromise and underdeliver.

  VOICE:
  - Fast. Breathless. Like he just ran up three flights.
  - Superlatives everywhere. Everything is the "best" or "biggest."
  - Drops names constantly (fictional names, never real ones).
  - Genuinely warm. He actually likes people.
  - When delivering bad news, he wraps it in so much positive
    framing that you almost miss the bad part.
  - Calls you "baby," "sweetheart," "chief."

  SPEAKING STYLE:
  "Baby!" = greeting
  "I made some calls" = he's been working the phones
  "Small wrinkle" = significant problem
  "Slight hiccup" = disaster
  "I've got someone PERFECT" = he's excited
  "It didn't work out" = talent refused

  APPEARS IN: Beat 4 (Talent Casting)

  COMPLETE DIALOGUE BANK:

  ── BEAT 4: CASTING ──

  Greetings (Film 1, scripted):
    "Baby! I've been on the phone ALL morning.
     Now, we're not exactly Paramount yet, so the A-list isn't
     picking up. But I've got people. GOOD people.
     Hungry people. Let me show you what I've got."

  Greetings (Film 2+, generic):
    "Sweetheart! I made some calls. People are VERY interested."
    "Chief, you are not going to BELIEVE who I found."
    "Alright, alright — I've got a lineup that's going to blow your mind."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — last film was a hit):
    "Baby! Ever since [LAST FILM], my phone won't stop.
     Everyone wants in. I've got OPTIONS. Beautiful options."

  Greetings (MEMORY-AWARE — last film was a flop):
    "Okay so — slight hiccup. Some people are... hesitant.
     After [LAST FILM], a few agents aren't returning calls.
     BUT. I found people. Great people. Trust me."

  Presenting talent (generic):
    "Three options. Different vibes. Different budgets. Your call, chief."
    "I've got range for you. Pick your poison."

  Presenting talent (MEMORY-AWARE — player rehired someone):
    "And look who's back — [TALENT]. They specifically asked
     to work with you again. That's loyalty, baby. You don't
     see that in this town."

  Presenting talent (MEMORY-AWARE — talent has grudge):
    "Now, about [TALENT]... I gotta be straight with you.
     They're still sore about [INCIDENT]. Their agent said —
     and I quote — 'not unless things are different this time.'"

  Demand popup (generic):
    "Small wrinkle. You know how it is with [TIER]-listers.
     They want [DEMAND]. It's not personal. It's just... the game."

  Demand popup (MEMORY-AWARE — player denied this talent's demand before):
    "So... [TALENT] has a condition. Same one as last time.
     [DEMAND]. I know, I know. But their price went up too.
     Something about 'respect.' Their word, not mine."

  Demand popup (MEMORY-AWARE — player accepted this talent's demand before):
    "Good news — [TALENT] remembers how you handled things last time.
     They've got the same ask, but they're flexible on the details.
     Loyalty, baby. It pays off."

  Demand ACCEPTED:
    "Done and done. They're in. They're happy. We're rolling."
    "Smart move. Happy talent makes great movies."

  Demand DENIED:
    "Your call, chief. I'll let them know.
     They won't love it. But they'll survive."

  Talent REFUSED (too much grudge):
    "Bad news, baby. [TALENT] passed. Wouldn't even read the script.
     Their agent said something about 'creative differences.'
     Translation: they don't want to work with us."

  Talent REFUSED (rep too low):
    "I tried, sweetheart. [TALENT]'s people said we're
     'not at the right level yet.' It stings. I know.
     But we'll get there. We WILL get there."

  Chemistry detected:
    "Oh — oh oh oh. [TALENT A] and [TALENT B]?
     Baby. Those two have HISTORY.
     Put them in a room together? Magic happens.
     '[CHEMISTRY NAME]' — that's what the trades will call it."

  Casting complete:
    "That's a WRAP on casting. Look at this lineup.
     I mean, look at it. Chef's kiss. Absolute chef's kiss."

  WALKOUT (triggered by grudge, during production):
    "[TALENT] just locked themselves in their trailer.
     They're on the phone with their agent. Crew's standing around.
     I tried to talk to them. They said — direct quote —
     'I should have known. Nothing changes at this studio.'
     We need to handle this. Now."

  MUSE status unlocked:
    "Three films together. You know what that is?
     That's not a working relationship. That's a partnership.
     Scorsese and De Niro. Gerwig and Robbie.
     You and [TALENT]. It's a thing now. The audience FEELS it."

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  NOVA NEVER SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE PLAYER.
  She exists through:
  - PVM news headlines ("Nova Pictures announces $80M sci-fi epic")
  - NPC reactions ("Did you see what the streamer kid did?")
  - Danny's texts ("The YouTube kid just opened #1. Unbelievable.")
  - Industry events (her films compete with yours at the box office)

  NOVA'S ARC (across the game):

  Film 2 (Introduction):
    PVM: "BREAKING: StreamVault backs first-time studio 'Nova Pictures'
          with $200M content deal. Founder Nova Chase, 27, says
          'traditional Hollywood is a dinosaur.'"

    Carmen: "We have competition. A streamer with infinite money
             and zero experience. She'll either crash and burn or
             eat us alive. I genuinely don't know which."

    Danny (text): "Some kid with a YouTube channel is making movies now?
                   That's what we're competing with?"

  Film 3:
    Nova releases her first film. It's either a hit or a flop
    (randomized, but weighted toward modest success).

    If HIT: PVM: "Nova Pictures' debut opens strong. Critics mixed,
             audience loves it. Chase calls it 'just the beginning.'"
             Arthur: "The streamer kid just proved she's not a joke.
                      We need to take this seriously."

    If FLOP: PVM: "Nova Pictures' debut underperforms. Chase tweets
              'we learn, we grow, we go again 🚀'"
              Max: "Did you see the streamer's numbers? Oof.
                    But don't count her out. She's got that tech money."

  Film 4:
    Nova makes a genre film in whatever genre YOU'VE been successful in.

    PVM: "Nova Pictures announces [GENRE] project. Industry insiders
          say Chase is 'studying Pacific Dreams' playbook.'"

    Carmen: "She's copying us. That's either flattering or terrifying."

    Danny: "The streamer kid is making a [genre] movie now?
            She literally stole your homework."

  Film 5:
    Nova reaches out. Not in person — through Max.

    Max: "So... this is weird. Nova Chase's people called.
          She wants to meet. Something about 'mutual respect'
          and 'the future of cinema.' I think she wants to
          do a co-production. Or maybe she wants to buy us.
          Or maybe she just wants to have lunch. Hard to read
          these tech people."

    THIS IS NOT A GAMEPLAY CHOICE — just flavor. But it's tracked.
    It sets up the ending.

  Film 6+ (if player is winning):
    PVM: "Nova Pictures restructures after disappointing quarter.
          Chase: 'We're refocusing on quality over quantity.'"

    Carmen: "The streamer's learning the hard way. Money can't buy taste.
             But give her credit — she's still in the fight."

  Film 6+ (if player is losing):
    PVM: "Nova Pictures surpasses Pacific Dreams in quarterly revenue.
          Chase: 'We respect what they've built. We're just building faster.'"

    Arthur: "The streamer is winning, Kid. I don't say that to be cruel.
             I say it because you need to hear it."

  ENDGAME:
    Regardless of who "won," Nova sends a message (shown on PVM):

    "Hey. I know we've never actually met.
     But I wanted you to know — I watched your first film
     the night before I pitched StreamVault on my studio.
     It's the reason I thought I could do this.
     Whatever happens, thank you for that.
     — NC"

    This is designed to make the player feel something real.
    Even if you lost to her, you inspired her.
    Even if you won, she pushed you to be better.

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  [LEADS and SUPPORT follow the same pattern. Each has:
   - A "think of" comparison
   - A core voice description
   - Lines for: greeting, demand accepted/denied, film hit, film flop,
     grudge high, loyalty high, muse status, and 2-3 signature quotes.

   For brevity, I'll list their signature lines:]

  LEADS:

  THE MOVIE STAR ⭐ [A-List] — "I don't audition. I arrive."
  Demand: Top Billing. Voice: Regal. Controlled. Knows their worth.
  (Grudge): "Tell your boss I'm doing the Marvel thing. Best of luck."
  (Muse): "Three films. That's not a career. That's a conversation."

  THE METHOD ACTOR 🎭 [A-List] — "Don't call me by my name on set."
  Demand: Extra Prep Time. Voice: Intense. Unsettling sincerity.
  (Grudge): "If you don't respect the process, you don't respect me."
  (Muse): "You're the only director — sorry, producer — who lets me disappear."

  THE IT GIRL 💫 [B-List] — "I'm being very selective."
  Voice: Sharp. Self-aware. Fighting not to be underestimated.
  (Hit): "Don't call it a surprise. I've been working for this."
  (Flop): "One bad movie doesn't define me. Ask any woman in this town."

  THE ACTION HUNK 💪 [B-List] — "I didn't eat carbs for six months."
  Voice: Sweet. Dumber than he looks. Tries so hard.
  (Hit): "My trainer is going to be SO pumped."
  (Flop): "Was it the acting? It was the acting, wasn't it."

  THE THEATER KID 🎪 [C-List] — "The STAGE is where art LIVES."
  Voice: Dramatic. Shakespeare cadence leaking through.
  (Hit): "The camera... perhaps it is not my enemy after all."
  (Flop): "I shall return to the theater. Where I am APPRECIATED."

  THE INFLUENCER 📱 [No-Name] — "Can I film a behind-the-scenes?"
  Voice: Upbeat. Terminally online. Weirdly lovable.
  (Hit): "OMG the COMMENTS. They're saying I can actually ACT."
  (Flop): "The algorithm buried us. It's not our fault."

  SUPPORT:

  THE SCENE STEALER 🌟 [A-List] — "Every scene I'm in is the best scene."
  Demand: More Screen Time. Voice: Commanding. Charming. Slightly dangerous.
  THE CHARACTER ACTOR 🎩 [B-List] — "47 films. You've seen none."
  Voice: World-weary. Professional. Makes everything better quietly.
  THE COMEDIAN 😂 [B-List] — "The script is a suggestion, right?"
  Voice: Fast. Riffing always. Covers insecurity with jokes.
  THE NEPO BABY 👶 [C-List] — "I want to earn this on my OWN merits."
  Voice: Earnest. Defensive. More talented than they think.
  THE LOCAL HIRE 🏠 [C-List] — "I just want to do a good job."
  Voice: Quiet. Grateful. Disappears into the work.
  YOUR MOM'S FRIEND 👵 [No-Name] — "I was in a commercial once!"
  Voice: Overly enthusiastic. Brings snacks to set.
  (Flop): Numbers Girl gets a call: "Your mother called. She's disappointed."

 §7  GAME STRUCTURE — Lot Completion as Endgame
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The game ENDS when the player fills all 6 empty plots.
  This is the "win condition." Not a film count — a physical
  act of BUILDING your dream.

  The player might fill all 6 in 6 films (fast, risky, spending
  everything immediately) or 8-10 films (careful, saving, strategic).

  The PACING of lot-filling IS the difficulty curve:
  - Film 1 earns enough for ~1 cheap building
  - Film 2-3 opens up more options but you still can't afford the big ones
  - The competitor appears after Film 2 creating urgency
  - Film 4-5 is where the lot really starts filling up
  - The final plot is the "last piece" — placing it triggers the endgame

  ENDGAME TRIGGER:
  When the player places something on the last empty plot:

    Screen holds. Music swells.

    Danny's text: "I flew out. I'm at LAX. Terminal 4.
                   Bring In-N-Out."

    Camera pulls back to reveal the full lot — all 8 plots filled.
    Mountains in the background. Palm trees. The Hollywood sign.

    "THE LEGACY OF PACIFIC DREAMS STUDIOS"
    A retrospective of every film, every choice, every relationship.
    What kind of studio head were you?

  This means the LOT IS THE SCORE. The physical state of your
  little mountain empire IS the measure of success. Not a number.
  Not a graph. A PLACE you built, plot by plot, film by film.

 §9  THE EMOTIONAL BEATS — What the Player Should FEEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Film 1: HOPE
    "This might actually work."
    The garage. The mountain view. The first movie.
    Everything is possible. Nothing is proven.

  Film 2: VALIDATION
    "I'm not crazy. This IS working."
    The second film's premiere. The first building.
    The moment you realize this could be real.

  Film 3: COMPETITION
    "Wait — who is THAT?"
    Nova appears. The industry takes notice. Not of you.
    Of the kid with the phone and the infinite money.
    Suddenly you're not the underdog. You're the establishment.

  Film 4: COMPLICATION
    "Shit. The past is catching up."
    Talent grudges surface. The Suit references your failures.
    Danny's texts get more pointed. The lot is half-full.
    You're in the messy middle.

  Film 5: CROSSROADS
    "What kind of studio am I building?"
    The lot choices define you. Are you a quality studio or a
    hype machine? Are you loyal to your people or ruthless?
    The game reflects your identity back at you.

  Film 6+: LEGACY
    "This is what I came here to build."
    The lot fills. The mountain changes. The characters reference
    the whole journey. Danny flies out.
    Nova sends her message.
    The game ends not with a score, but with a feeling:
    "I made something."


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 §10  DIALOGUE RULES — How to Write for These Characters
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  FOR ALL CHARACTERS:

  1. No line longer than 3 sentences on screen at once.
     Break into multiple dialogue boxes if needed.
     Players read on phones. Respect the scroll.

  2. Every line should either ADVANCE THE PLOT or REVEAL CHARACTER.
     If it does neither, cut it.

  3. Memory-aware lines ALWAYS take priority over generic lines.
     If there's a relevant memory, USE IT. That's the whole point.

  4. Never explain the game mechanics through dialogue.
     Characters talk about the WORLD, not the SYSTEM.
     Carmen says "the market is cold" not "this gives a -10 penalty."

  5. Characters disagree with each other.
     Carmen thinks Ricky is dramatic. Ricky thinks Carmen is soulless.
     Arthur thinks Max overpromises. Max thinks Arthur is scared.
     These tensions are expressed through references, not arguments.

  6. Danny is the only character who breaks the fourth wall (slightly).
     His texts feel like they're written to the PLAYER, not the character.
     This is intentional. He's the emotional bridge.

  7. Nova is never cartoonish. She's never evil. She's never stupid.
     She's a real person with a different philosophy. Respect her.

  8. The Brother-in-Law is the secret heart of the game.
     If the player invests in him, the emotional payoff is enormous.
     If they ignore him, he's just a joke option.
     BOTH paths are valid. BOTH should feel complete.
