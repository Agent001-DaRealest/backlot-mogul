 §1  THE PHILOSOPHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Lionhead's genius was never the AI. It was the RECEIPTS.

  In Fable, if you kicked a chicken in Oakvale, a farmer mentioned
  it three hours later. The player didn't think anyone was watching.
  That's the magic — the feeling of being watched by a world that
  cares about what you did.

  Our version: every choice the player makes — even ones that seem
  cosmetic or throwaway — gets logged to a MEMORY LEDGER. We don't
  need to USE every entry right away. We just need to HAVE it, so
  that when we write dialogue or trigger events, we can reach back
  and pull something out that makes the player say "holy shit, it
  remembered that."

  The key insight: TRACK EVERYTHING. USE IT LATER.
  Don't design the payoff first. Design the tracking first.
  The payoffs will suggest themselves.

 §2  THE MEMORY LEDGER — What We Track
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The Memory Ledger is a flat array in the Zustand store.
  Each entry is a small object:

  {
    film: 1,                    // which film number
    beat: 'talent',             // which phase it happened in
    tag: 'demand_denied',       // machine-readable tag for lookups
    actor: 'The Auteur',        // who was involved
    detail: 'final_cut',        // specifics
    sentiment: -2,              // how the NPC "feels" about it (-3 to +3)
    timestamp: 4,               // turn number (for ordering)
    surfaced: false,            // has this been referenced in dialogue yet?
  }

  THE WES ANDERSON WALKOUT EXAMPLE (from your prompt):

    Film 1: Player hires The Auteur. Auteur demands Final Cut.
            Player DENIES the demand. Film is made. Auteur's grudge +1.

    Film 2: Player hires The Auteur again. Auteur demands Final Cut again.
            Connector: "Look, they're still sore about last time.
            But they'll do it. Just... maybe give them what they want?"
            Player DENIES again. Grudge now at +3.

    Film 3: During production, WALKOUT CRISIS triggers.
            Crisis card: "The Auteur has locked themselves in their
            trailer. They're calling their agent. The crew is standing
            around. You have 30 minutes before this costs you $200K."

            Option A: "Give them Final Cut. End this."
              → Quality +10, but Auteur gets Final Cut (future films
                with this director always have +Q but unpredictable tone)

            Option B: "Fire them. Promote the AD."
              → Quality -15, but you're free. Auteur's grudge maxes out.
                They will NEVER work with you again. Connector:
                "That bridge isn't just burned. It's vaporized."

  This is the Lionhead loop: TRACK → ACCUMULATE → SURPRISE.

 §5  THE STAR SYSTEM — No Bars, Just Stars
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Status bars give away too much information. They let the player
  min-max instead of FEEL. Stars are better because:

  1. They change in DISCRETE STEPS (not smooth gradients)
  2. The player can't tell exactly when a star will fill or empty
  3. Multiple choices accumulate before a star changes
  4. The "moment" a star changes carries emotional weight

  IMPLEMENTATION:

  │  Then a +3 bonus tips it over the threshold — feels big.               │
  │  The player doesn't know the +5 was "wasted."                          │

 §6  THE COMBINED LOT — Universal Studios Layout
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Instead of separate LOT and PARK screens, they're ONE place.
  Like the real Universal Studios, where the backlot IS the park.
  The studio grew, the park grew around it. They're inseparable.

  LAYOUT: 2×4 horizontal grid, landscape orientation.
  Studio and Park are the two CENTER FRONT squares.
  Six empty squares frame them like a mountainside.

  THE MOUNTAINTOP FRAMING:

  Mountains, trees, and clouds frame the grid.
  As the studio grows, the landscape changes:

    Film 1-2:  Wild mountainside. Trees everywhere. Dirt road.
               Feels like you're building in the middle of nowhere.

    Film 3-4:  Road paves. Power lines appear. A few buildings exist.
               Feels like progress. Still scrappy.

    Film 5-6:  Hollywood sign visible in background. Palm trees.
               Studio lot is filled. Park rides are running.
               Feels like you've MADE IT.

    Film 7+:   Full resort. Lit up at night (if game time advances).
               Feels like a legacy.

  This is COSMETIC — driven by total plot count, not game logic.
  But it makes the world feel alive and responsive.

  BUILDING CONSOLIDATION (from 9 buildings to 8 possible):

  Instead of 9 separate buildings, we streamline:

  RIDES (placed on empty plots, from successful films):

  When a film is a HIT or BLOCKBUSTER, you can build a ride from it.
  The ride occupies one plot permanently (unless demolished).
  Rides generate passive income between films.
  Adjacent rides with synergy genres get bonuses.

 §7  THE SCRIPTED FIRST GAME — A Guided Experience
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The first playthrough is tightly scripted. Not a tutorial —
  a STORY. The player feels like they're making choices, but
  we're controlling the pacing and ensuring specific moments hit.

  BEATABLE IN ONE SITTING:

  7 films × ~3-5 minutes each = 21-35 minutes.
  Plus lot/park management between films = ~40-50 minutes total.
  That's a lunch break. That's a commute. That's one sitting.

 §8  THE DIALOGUE ENGINE — How NPCs Reference History
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Every NPC dialogue line has two parts:
    1. BASE LINE — the generic version
    2. MEMORY OVERRIDE — a version that references history

  The dialogue system checks the Memory Ledger FIRST.
  If it finds a relevant, unsurfaced memory, it uses the override.
  Then it marks that memory as surfaced: true.

  STRUCTURE:

  function getDialogue(character, context, ledger) {
    // 1. Check for unsurfaced memories relevant to this context
    const memories = ledger.filter(m =>
      !m.surfaced &&
      m.actor === relevantActor &&
      MEMORY_TRIGGERS[context]?.includes(m.tag)
    );

    // 2. If memory found, use the memory-aware line
    if (memories.length > 0) {
      const memory = memories[0];
      memory.surfaced = true;
      return MEMORY_LINES[character][memory.tag](memory);
    }

    // 3. Otherwise, use the generic line
    return pick(BASE_LINES[character][context]);
  }

 §13  THE MAGIC MOMENT — Why This Works
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Film 1: Player hires Your Brother-in-Law as director.
          Player thinks: "Haha, cheapest option, whatever."
          We track: { tag:'brother_in_law', film:1, sentiment:0 }

  Film 2: Connector mentions it offhand:
          "Your brother-in-law called. He wants to do another one.
           Something about 'proving himself.' His words."
          Player thinks: "Oh, that's a nice touch."

  Film 3: Player hires him again. He's still cheap.
          Player thinks: "Easy choice for my low-budget film."
          We track: { tag:'talent_rehired', actor:'BIL', timesHired:2 }

  Film 4: Player hires him a THIRD time.
          Connector: "Three films together. You know what that makes
          him? Your MUSE. Scorsese had De Niro. Spielberg had Hanks.
          You have... your wife's brother. But hey, it's working."

          MUSE STATUS UNLOCKED: permanent +5 quality.

  Film 5: The Brother-in-Law film becomes a BLOCKBUSTER.
          PVM News: "FROM GARAGE TO GLORY: How a wedding videographer
          became Hollywood's most unlikely auteur"

          Brother-in-Law permanently upgraded from No-Name to C-List.
          His quality stat goes from 2 to 8.

  Film 6: A-List talent references the Brother-in-Law:
          "I saw what you did with [BIL's film]. If you can make HIM
          look good, imagine what you can do with ME."
          → A-List talent MORE likely to accept your projects.

  This is ONE chain. From ONE throwaway choice in Film 1.
  The player didn't plan any of this. It EMERGED from tracking.
  That's the Lionhead feeling.
