I'm building BACKLOT MOGUL — a movie studio tycoon game that runs inside a retro CRT
terminal. Think "Game Dev Tycoon meets Hollywood" rendered in phosphor green and amber.

THE GAME: You buy a studio, hire talent, choose genres, make movies, handle crises,
watch box office results, and build out your physical lot. 8 films, 8 buildings, then
your legacy is scored.

WHAT WORKS:
- 6 of 7 game phases are fully playable (PreProd → Production → Marketing → Premiere → Lot → repeat)
- 5 NPC characters with 600+ lines of memory-driven dialogue (they remember your decisions)
- 6 player archetypes calculated from play history: Auteur, Mogul, People's Champion,
  Gambler, Loyalist, Shark
- A rival studio (Nova Chase) that appears at Film 3 and sometimes copies your genre picks
- Danny Sullivan — your best friend from Boston — sends iMessage-style texts between films

WHAT'S MISSING:
- ENDGAME SCREEN: When all 8 lot slots are filled, the game shows a placeholder.
  Needs a "legacy report" — studio valuation, filmography, archetype reveal,
  Danny's final letter, Nova's farewell note, and a reboot button.

THE AESTHETIC: Everything is inline-styled React. CRT housing with scanlines, phosphor
glow, vignette. Two font stacks: Orbitron (display) and Share Tech Mono (data).
Color palette: green (#39ff14), amber (#f1c40f), red (#ff4444), cyan (#00ddcc),
orange (#ff9e64), on near-black (#0a0a0a) backgrounds.

Ask me anything about the design, story, or systems — I have full documentation.
